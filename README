                                  =========

License
=======
This code is copyright Neil Robertson 2016-2017 and it is NOT GPL'd or under any
other public license. Don't like that? Then don't use it. You have permission
to use the interpreter to write and distribute your own programs with no 
license fee required. You may also distribute the interpreter source code but
you CANNOT use any of the C source code in your own projects.


Intro
=====
This is an old fashioned line BASIC interpreter which probably works in much
the way you'd expect. However since it runs in a Unix enviroment there is 
support for things you wouldn't find in old fashioned BASICs such as multi
process, IPC and networking.
   There is an example_progs directory containing plenty of code to get you
going and there is also a DOCS directory containing full documentation of all 
the commands and functions of the language.


Compiling
=========
This interpreter was written and tested on Linux, OS/X and FreeBSD 6. It should
therefore compile and run without problems on these systems. Any other systems 
I cannot vouch for.
	The C source code lives in the src directory where there is a Makefile. 
Make sure you uncomment the correct lines for your OS in this file first before 
compiling by typing "make". 


Running
=======
Once compiled just type "basic" with any of the following command line options:

Usage: basic
      [-p <.bas file>] : BASIC program file
      [-h <lines>]     : Number of history lines. Default = 20
      [-r <run arg>]   : Sets _run_arg system variable
      [-a]             : Autorun program
      [--]             : Everything following this gets passed to BASIC as
                         _argv with _argc system variables set
