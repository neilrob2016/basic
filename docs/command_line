The Command Line
================
There are 2 command lines - the unix command line and the BASIC command line.
To start the interpreter at the unix command line you can either type "basic"
on its own or use it with the following self explanatory options:

Usage: basic
      [-p <.bas file>] : BASIC program file
      [-h <lines>]     : Number of history lines. Default = 20
      [-r <run arg>]   : Sets _run_arg system variable
      [-a]             : Autorun program
      [--]             : Everything following this gets passed to BASIC as
                         $argv system variables

The BASIC command line has a prompt of "]" and allows interactive editing of
text using the arrow keys to move left and right in the text and the Insert key
to switch between text insert and text overwrite. Use the HISTORY command to 
show a list of previous commands you've entered and you can re-run the command 
using !<command number> and use the EDIT command to bring a program line into
the edit buffer to update it.
