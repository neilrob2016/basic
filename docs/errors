        "Cannot input from the printer"
        "Invalid label name"
        "Duplicate label"
        "Undefined label"

One thing to note is that with mathematical functions, if an invalid value is
passed then usually the error will be "Invalid argument". However if the value
is constrained between 2 values , eg -1 -> 1 for inverse trig functions, then
an "Out of range" error will be seen instead.
